== Description ==

The Theme Options Panel Framework makes it easy to include an options panel in any WordPress theme.  It was built so that theme developers can concentrate on making the actual theme rather than spending a ton of time on creating an options panel from scratch.  It's free to use in both commercial and personal projects.

This code is based on the Thematic Options Panel (http://wptheming.com/2010/11/thematic-options-panel-v2/)
That code is heavily based on the [WooFramework](http://www.woothemes.com/) and their option styles.

== Installation ==

Place the options folder in your theme or child theme folder.
Define TOPF_OPTIONS with the name of your options table entry for WordPress.  All options are bound into an array and filed into the TOPF_OPTIONS entry.
Include the main options.php file into your theme:
	define( 'TOPF_OPTIONS', 'theme_divergence_options' );
	require_once( get_stylesheet_directory() . '/options/options.php' );
Setup the options you wish to use in The Array ($topf_theme_options) found in ./options/theme_default_options.php
Alter the validation for each option in ./options/option-register.php
Include the implementation file (change and add your own implementations here)
	require_once( get_stylesheet_directory() . '/options/options-implement.php' );
